## Perspective

Firmly anchored in our shared understanding of life, we acknowledge that our vitality hinges on the potent combination of the brain and heart. These two powerhouse mechanisms dictate our journey through the world, guiding our perception of reality.

Our five senses serve as our internal compass, enabling us to engage with our surroundings and form our perception of the universe. They equip us to absorb the grand spectacle through our eyes, decode a tapestry of scents with our noses, savor the symphony of sounds with our ears, delve into an assortment of flavors with our tongues, and map the intricacies of our environment through touch. These senses offer us a tangible connection to our world, shaping our understanding and grounding us in our distinctly human experience.

In the march towards progress, mankind has deftly employed technology to amplify these sensory experiences. Fire, the primordial innovation, gifted us with warmth and protection, while the advent of the internet in our era has brought us unprecedented levels of global connectivity.

## Leverage

From the earliest flicker of human existence, we have harnessed the power of technology as a steadfast tool to bolster our survival and enhance our living standards. Each pivotal invention, whether it was the primal breakthrough of fire or the modern marvel of the internet, has set in motion a cascade of advancements, launching us into an epoch of exponential progress.

These leaps in innovation unlock a wealth of opportunities that continually shape and reshape our human narrative, demonstrating how our past discoveries serve as the foundation for our future breakthroughs. This cyclical process underscores our persistent endeavor to push boundaries and redefine the limits of what we perceive as possible.

## The Human Interface

Our sojourn on Earth, encapsulated as the 'Human Interface', marks our transient yet transformative passage on this planet. We employ first-principles thinking as our guide, stripping down complex phenomena to uncover the essential truths that underpin our existence.

This clear-sighted perspective, amplified by the compelling leverage of technology, enables us to venture into unexplored territories, push boundaries, and expand the reach of our collective human narrative. Through this prism, we go beyond mere survival. We lead, we innovate, and we sculpt the very essence of our shared existence.

As we delve deeper into this exploration, we stand on the cusp of the next frontier: artificial spatial computing. This emerging dimension of the Human Interface forms the crux of our discussion, promising a revolutionary shift in how we engage with technology and, by extension, our perception of reality.

## The Genesis

[Genesis 1:1-5] In the beginning God created the hevens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."

## Purpose

In the vast expanse of existence, we find ourselves drawn to ponder over the seminal questions: How did we originate? What catalyzed this grand initiation of life? The gravity of these introspections is unmatched, as they carry a profound significance that overshadows all else. Are we to succumb to the uncertainty or are we to rise, seeking resolution and clarity?

I posit that this quest for certainty is a noble undertaking, serving as a testament to our relentless drive to comprehend the Alpha and the Omega. It is our primal duty to cherish the inestimable gift of life we are bestowed, while, paramountly, seeking to glorify God. I uphold the belief that the purpose of our existence is dual-faceted: to strive for our own salvation and to assist others on their parallel journey towards redemption.

It's crucial to acknowledge that we possess no material wealth to offer God. It is reasonable to surmise that an all-powerful God, the master creator, doesn't need us. However, He did sculpt us with a clear intention, a purpose. "Then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature." [Genesis 2:7]

Our freedom to align with God's will, to seek truth and understanding, is beautifully encapsulated in the biblical words: "Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own." [John 7:17 (NIV)]. Thus, we set forth on this enlightening journey, powered by faith and a steadfast commitment to fulfill our God-ordained destiny.

The book of Joshua 24:15 (NIV) puts forth a pivotal choice before humanity: "But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."

In this powerful proclamation, Joshua doesn't merely offer a choice—he provokes a thoughtful decision. He challenges people to make a conscious commitment to whom they will serve: the gods of their ancestry, the gods of their current lands, or like Joshua and his family, pledge themselves to the LORD's service? This defining moment underscores not just our freedom to choose, but also the immense responsibility that accompanies such a choice in shaping our spiritual odyssey.

## Destiny

As we persistently evolve the human interface, a pressing question arises: what should be the direction of this metamorphosis, and what role should it fulfill in our lives? All our innovations—past, present, and future—are borne from the divine resources bequeathed upon us by the Creator. In this realm of boundless possibilities, discerning the righteous path becomes an indispensable task.

Our quest for answers requires unremitting introspection and unwavering moral resilience. The Bible, as the Word of God, provides a guiding light, its profound wisdom illuminating our pathway. Central to this wisdom is the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Jesus declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6 NIV). His teachings serve as a moral blueprint, enabling us to navigate the labyrinth of life and the challenges brought forth by rapidly advancing technology.

As we delve into the uncharted terrains of artificial intelligence and spatial computing—potentially revolutionizing the human interface—we must ensure that our strides are in alignment with Jesus' teachings. Our technological endeavors should reverberate with values of integrity, compassion, and humility, mirroring the grace and forgiveness that God offers us through Christ.

The essence of God's forgiveness is eloquently encapsulated in Ephesians 1:7 (NIV): "In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace." By accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, we open the door to this divine forgiveness, transforming our lives and our relationship with God.

In our pursuit of technological advancement, we can look to Jesus as a model. Before his ministry, Jesus was a carpenter, working diligently in his chosen profession. In Mark 6:3 (NIV), he is referred to as "the carpenter," a testament to his commitment to his craft. This offers a compelling parallel to our work in AI and spatial computing. Like Jesus, we strive to be masters of our profession, creating with intention, purpose, and a deep understanding of our craft. Yet, we must remember to align our works with the teachings and values of Christ, ensuring that our creations contribute positively to humanity and reflect God's grace.

Guided by the Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—we must harmonize our collective purpose with our technological breakthroughs. As Colossians 3:17 (NIV) advises, "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."

As we continue to enhance the human interface, we must remember the transience of our earthly existence. This realization should inspire us to seek the ultimate perspective—the perspective of eternity. Our innovations should resonate with the teachings of Christ, embodying the love, grace, and forgiveness of God. Thus, our progress not only caters to our physical needs but also nourishes our spiritual purpose, as directed by our Creator.

In this manner, our destiny unfolds as a tapestry of technological progress interwoven with spiritual growth, epitomizing a harmonious confluence of advancement and faith. It's a journey that reflects the divine love of the Trinity, with our continual quest to create being driven by a deep-seated passion for our work and an unwavering commitment to the teachings of Jesus Christ.
